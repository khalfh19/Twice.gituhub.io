              <p class="tipis">Twice is releasing their 7th mini album'FANCY YOU'.</p>
              <p class="tulis">'Asia's One Top Girl Group' Twice has returned. Twice, who is loved by the public, conveys happiness through bright and catchy songs and energetic performances.
                This time, we present a new and richer album with a gorgeous and fascinating concept.
                Twice's new appearance that surprises everyone and the wider and deeper musical depth of the members directly participating in the lyrics clearly show their efforts and growth.</p>
              <p class="tulis">The title song'FANCY' is a mellow mood pop dance song that announces TWICE's musical changes with a color concept that is distinctly different from what Twice has shown so far.
                Under the tropical light cloud and the intense sun, Twice, who left in search of love with both feet, delivers a confession of love without hesitation, saying, "I will never let go."
                The lyrics containing a provocation different from the past, such as “What if someone likes it first,” are enough to double the charm of Twice.</p>
              <p class="tulis">The trendy sensibility and elegant flute sound that stand out like the 2019 trend color neon, show off splendor and boldness, clearly reveal Twice's full of confidence.
                Twice's unique energetic charm is preserved, while its intensity and uniqueness are added, presenting a new horizon of K-POP as well as a further developed Twice style.
                The music video with a distinctly different tone, color, and sensational composition from the previous one is at the peak of this change.
                Now that it has entered its fifth year of debut, these changes are not limited to TWICE, but resemble the unstoppable expansion of K-POP, which is further developing. The global repercussion of this album is also a reason to be highly expected.</p>
              <p class="tulis">In particular, the title song “FANCY” was written and composed by “Black Eyed Pilseung X All Army”, which is called Twice and Honey Combination.
                It was a reunion with the mega hit maker Black Eyed Pil-seung, who worked on the debut song ‘OOH-AHH-ha-ha’, ‘CHEER UP’, ‘TT’, and ‘LIKEY’, so he announced a blast again.</p>
              <p class="tulis">The new album'FANCY YOU' includes a total of 6 tracks including the title song'FANCY','STUCK IN MY HEAD','GIRLS LIKE US','HOT','TURN IT UP', and'STRAWBERRY'.
                Composers with a brilliant lineup, such as Grammy Award winner “Charli XCX,” participated in the album and received hot attention from billboards and fans even before the release.</p>
              <p class="tulis">The album's completeness was enhanced with new songs touched by the Twice members. Twice's 2nd mini album'PAGE TWO''s'Precious Love' began with Chaeyoung's participation in rap making, mini's 4th album'SIGNAL''EYE EYE EYES', and the 5th mini's'What is Love?''HO! 'And'SWEET TALKER','Shot thru the heart' of the special 2nd album'Summer Nights','LALALA','YOUNG & WILD' and'SUNSET' of the 6th mini album'YES or YES', etc. He has participated and has demonstrated his musical capabilities. In this album, Jihyo on track 3'GIRLS LIKE US', Momo on track 4'HOT', Sana on track 5'TURN IT UP', and Chaeyoung on track 6'STRAWBERRY' participated in the lyrics.
                The song that participated in the song and the usual characteristics of each member were so well harmonized that the release of the track list alone attracted a lot of attention to fans.</p>
              <p class="tulis">Since their debut song, Twice has portrayed the growth of a "girl in front of love". In the midst of showing changes, such as sending a “signal” to the other person and expressing the bold answer to choose only one of “YES or YES”,
                In this album, not only love, but also more active Twice is drawn in various aspects, allowing a glimpse of active and leading “growth”.</p>
                <p class="tulis">Twice has gained a reputation as an “Asian One-Top Girl Group” based on its high-quality stage and various activities. In addition to reaching the top of domestic and overseas sound sources and album charts, the record of'Best' and'First', such as surpassing 100 million views of music videos for 10 consecutive active songs, winning the 1st prize in music broadcasting, winning various awards ceremony, and the completion of a Japanese dome tour, has been accumulated.

This'FANCY YOU' will be remembered as an album where you can feel Twice's first heart and the pride of the fans who love them.</p>
